I recommend keeping the domain in GoDaddy and managing DNS in Azure using Terraform. This is the best approach because:

  ✅ Recommended: Domain in GoDaddy + DNS in Azure

  Benefits:

  1. Cost effective: GoDaddy domain registration ($15/year) + Azure DNS ($0.50/month)
  2. Better performance: Azure DNS has global anycast network
  3. Terraform managed: Full infrastructure as code
  4. Advanced features: Traffic routing, health checks, private DNS
  5. Integration: Seamless with Azure services

  How it works:

  1. Domain stays in GoDaddy: You keep renewing there
  2. Name servers point to Azure: Change NS records in GoDaddy
  3. DNS managed in Terraform: All DNS records in your code

  Setup Process:

  Step 1: Deploy Terraform (DNS enabled)

  # In terraform.tfvars
  enable_azure_dns = true
  domain_name = "kubeopt.com"

  Step 2: Get Azure name servers (after deployment)

  terraform output dns_zone_name_servers

  Step 3: Update GoDaddy name servers

  1. Login to GoDaddy
  2. Go to DNS Management for kubeopt.com
  3. Change name servers to Azure ones (from terraform output)
  4. Wait 24-48 hours for propagation

  Alternative: Full Azure Domain Transfer

  ❌ Not recommended because:

  - More expensive: Azure domain registration costs more
  - Complex transfer: 60-day wait periods, verification steps
  - Risk: Potential downtime during transfer
  - Overkill: For a simple website, DNS management is sufficient

  Current Terraform Configuration:

  Your setup already supports this approach:
  - enable_azure_dns = true creates Azure DNS zone
  - Terraform manages all DNS records (A, CNAME, MX, TXT, CAA)
  - Outputs provide the name servers you need

  Recommendation: Stick with your current approach - domain in GoDaddy, DNS in Azure via Terraform. It's cost-effective and gives you full control.
